# Arithmetic Expression Parser and Visualizer

## Description
This Java program parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions represented in infix notation and visualizes the corresponding expression trees using the BRIDGES API. It can handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within parentheses.

The program builds a parse tree from the input expression, evaluates the expression, and provides the result. Additionally, it generates and visualizes the expression tree, which helps users understand how the expression is structured.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- The BRIDGES API library, which can be obtained from [BRIDGES website](https://bridgesuncc.github.io/).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arithmetic-expression-parser.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Ensure you have the BRIDGES API library added to your project's build path.

4. Open the Project5.java file and review the code to understand how the program works.

5. Modify the ex1, ex2, ex3, and ex4 strings to represent the arithmetic expressions you want to parse and evaluate.

6. Run the main method in the Project5 class. This will parse, evaluate, and visualize the provided expressions.

7. The program will display the results of the evaluated expressions and print the corresponding infix expressions.

8. The BRIDGES visualization window will open, showing the expression trees.

9. Customize the code or add additional expressions as needed for your project.

10. Make sure to replace your-username in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username.

11. Enjoy parsing, evaluating, and visualizing arithmetic expressions!

```
Please replace `your-username` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username and adjust any other details as needed to match your project structure. This README provides a basic overview of the project, its requirements, and how to run it. You can expand it further with additional sections or details if necessary.
